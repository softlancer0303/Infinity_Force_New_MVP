# Infinity Force

## Project Technical Description

**Project Name:** Infinity Force (inferred from folder name)

### Overview

Infinity Force is a full-stack web application with a focus on blockchain, gaming, and user engagement features. The project is built using a modern JavaScript/TypeScript stack, leveraging Next.js for the frontend, Node.js/Express for the backend, and integrates with smart contracts (as suggested by the presence of `abis/` and web3-related components).

---

### Frontend

- **Framework:** Next.js (React-based, SSR/SSG support)
- **Languages:** TypeScript, JavaScript
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS, custom CSS modules, and global styles
- **Component Structure:** Highly modular, with directories for features like dashboard, bridge, collab, ranking, gamer, developer, and more.
- **Web3 Integration:** Components and hooks for wallet connections, NFT/SBT status, and blockchain interactions.
- **State Management:** Custom state management in the `store/` directory, likely using Zustand, Redux, or a similar library.
- **Utilities:** Custom hooks for authentication, contract interaction, user management, and more.

---

### Backend

- **Framework:** Node.js with Express (inferred from `server.js` and `app.js`)
- **Languages:** JavaScript
- **Features:**
  - RESTful API endpoints for orders, payments, products, and users.
  - Controllers, models, and routes organized by domain.
  - Middleware for authentication, validation, error handling, and notifications.
  - Data storage using JSON files (e.g., `products.json`, `cart.json`), with potential for database integration.
  - Static file serving for images, invoices, and public assets.

---

### Blockchain & Web3

- **Smart Contract ABIs:** Located in `abis/`, indicating interaction with multiple contracts (badge, bridge, collab, etc.).
- **Web3 Utilities:** Custom hooks and utilities for contract calls, wallet connections, and blockchain event handling.
- **NFT/SBT Features:** Components for displaying and managing NFTs, SBTs, and related user statuses.

---

### Additional Features

- **Airdrop & Rewards:** Components and backend logic for airdrop mechanisms, referrals, and user rewards.
- **Collaboration & Social:** Features for collaboration, social media integration, and community engagement.
- **Gamification:** Ranking systems, power levels, and badges for both gamers and developers.
- **Poster & Sharing:** Poster generation and sharing utilities, possibly for social campaigns or achievements.

---

### Tooling & Configuration

- **Linting & Formatting:** ESLint and Prettier configuration for code quality.
- **Build Tools:** PostCSS, Tailwind, and Next.js configuration files.
- **Environment Management:** Example environment config for backend.
